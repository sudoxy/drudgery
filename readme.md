Note - Don't do any work in order, or repeating... if you don't want to make habit of it... 
do important even stuffs in "no order"...

Human brain works on various chemicals, having their own purpose for creating a fluent 
mechanism... for that the activity should be consisten, constant (i.e existence, time)...
	~ so in the first place, the activites which can be tracked in some order, can easyly be 		   
          learned by subcsoncious brain, mainly in a optimized form...

That's the procedure of easy, and hence makes some acks so much necessary to be constant like 
	~ biological rythm : for propper sleep (i.e health, no compromise)
	~ RTFMS : Human survival (i.e for future, no compromise dude)

and in the rest time, there would be lot of queued practical application stuff... 

This program is just the shadow of the time, and scedule... you're still gonna do 
whatever the fuck you would... but this shadow makes it eazy to organise the tasks 
in your computer atleast, you understand the value of integrity... doesn't matter 
by exactly which thing you'll get reminded...
